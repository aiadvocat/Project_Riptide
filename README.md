Welcome to Project Riptide — an open source, community-driven, totally radical arcade game that will transport you straight back to the neon-soaked glory days of the 1980s!

🕹️ What is Project Riptide?

Project Riptide is a side-scrolling, wave-riding, boss-blasting, high-score-chasing adventure set in a sprawling universe where every level feels like your favorite 80s arcade machine — but cooler.
