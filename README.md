**🌊 Project Riptide**

Welcome to Project Riptide — an open source, community-driven, totally radical arcade game that will transport you straight back to the neon-soaked glory days of the 1980s!

Built with ❤️ by Protovision, Project Riptide is more than just a game.
It’s a movement.
It’s a party.
It’s a riptide of pixelated nostalgia crashing into the future!

	✨ Best of all: It’s 100% free, open source, and proudly non-confidential. Sharing is caring! ✨

🕹️ What is Project Riptide?

Project Riptide is a side-scrolling, wave-riding, boss-blasting, high-score-chasing adventure set in a sprawling universe where every level feels like your favorite 80s arcade machine — but cooler.

Think:
	•	The colorful chaos of Galaga 🚀
	•	The endless energy of OutRun 🏎️
	•	The rhythmic madness of Bubble Bobble 🫧
	•	The pixel-perfect charm of Double Dragon 🥋

Now, smash all that together, crank up the synths, and you’ve got Project Riptide.

🎯 Project Goals
	•	Bring back the spirit of classic arcades in an open and collaborative way.
	•	Inspire creativity through accessible code and vibrant art.
	•	Build a community of retro-lovers, pixel artists, sound magicians, and gameplay wizards.
	•	Prove that open source gaming can be just as thrilling as the golden age of quarters and joysticks.

🛠️ Game Design Philosophy

At its core, Project Riptide is about maximum fun, minimum friction.
We design with these simple principles:
	•	Arcade Feel, Modern Heart:
Every frame, sprite, and sound effect is tuned to feel like dropping a quarter into a machine at your favorite mall arcade.
	•	Easy to Play, Tough to Master:
New players can hop in immediately. Veterans can chase insane skill ceilings, stylish combos, and ridiculous high scores.
	•	Community First:
Modding tools, accessible code, and a fully open development roadmap mean you’re not just playing Riptide — you’re helping build it.
	•	Secret Sauce:
Easter eggs, hidden levels, and secret codes are sprinkled liberally. If you think you’ve seen it all, think again.
	•	Vibes Over Polygons:
We care less about hyper-realism and more about hyper-awesome.

💸 Monetization Strategy - There's no point in keeping this a secret because, let’s be honest — we love making games, but eating food is also cool.

That’s why Project Riptide uses an innovative, Totally Tubular Reverse-Pyramid Revenue System™:
	•	🌀 Step 1: You play the game for free.
	•	🌀 Step 2: You love the game. (Guaranteed.)
	•	🌀 Step 3: You choose to support us by:
	•	Buying stylish Project Riptide merch (yes, including neon headbands).
	•	Donating via our totally rad Patreon for exclusive behind-the-scenes content.
	•	Purchasing optional DLC packs, featuring purely cosmetic upgrades (surfboard skins, pixel shades, mullet enhancers, etc.).
	•	Joining the Riptide Vanguard for secret early access and voting rights on future features (no NFTs, promise).
	•	🌀 Step 4: You tell two friends, who tell two friends, who tell two friends…

	🌊 Reminder: Core gameplay will always be free and open source.
We believe the greatest currency is good vibes. (But coffee money is nice too.)
